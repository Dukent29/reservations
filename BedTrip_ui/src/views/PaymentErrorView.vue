<!--
  PaymentErrorView
  =================
  Vue view that will replace front/payment-error.html.

  Responsibilities (to implement later):
  - Show a clear error message when payment fails or is canceled.
  - Optionally display:
    - Partner order id or token if available from query/session.
    - Short explanation of what went wrong, using information from URL or API.
  - Provide navigation actions:
    - Button to go back to the booking form.
    - Link to retry payment or contact support.
  - Maintain visual consistency with other views (AppShell, cards, buttons).

<template>
  <div class="payment-error-view">
    <!-- User-friendly payment error message and actions will go here. -->
  </div>

<script setup>
// Future imports:
// - Layout components (AppShell/AppHeader/AppFooter).
// - Possibly a small helper composable to read and display error context.
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Local view-specific styling for the payment error page. */
</style>
